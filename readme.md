## 🚀 Overview

This project focuses on generating a **synthetic yet realistic retail store dataset** and performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights related to sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, inventory, and operational efficiency.

The dataset mirrors a real-world multi-category store with customer segments, product metadata, pricing, profitability, and logistics information.

## 🛠️ Components & Their Purposes

### **1. data_generator.py**

A Python script powered by the **Faker** library to create clean, structured, high-volume synthetic retail data.

**Key Functionalities:**

* Generates 1000+ rows of customer-order-product information.
* Creates realistic fields (customer info, category, region, inventory, supplier data).
* Automatically calculates:

  * Sales Amount
  * Cost Price
  * Profit
  * Discount effects
* Simulates shipping timelines, delivery status, reorder logic, stock conditions, etc.
* Saves the final dataset as **Store_Management_System.csv**.

---

### **2. Store_Management_System.csv**

This is the **main dataset** generated by the script.
It contains:

* Customer Demographics
* Product & Category Details
* Pricing, Discount, and Profitability
* Order & Shipping Information
* Supplier Data
* Inventory Metrics (Stock Left, Auto Reorder)
* Delivery Status & Payment Mode

**Shape:** ~1000 rows × 26 columns

---

### **3. eda-store-management.ipynb**

A complete Jupyter Notebook performing detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

**Analysis Performed:**

* Data cleaning & formatting
* Statistical summaries
* Missing value treatment
* Feature analysis (numerical & categorical)
* Sales & Profit trend analysis
* Category-level breakdowns
* Customer segment insights
* Delivery & payment behavior analysis
* Inventory risk detection
* Correlation heatmaps & distribution plots
* Outlier analysis

**Visualizations Include:**

* Bar plots, count plots
* Line charts for temporal trends
* Pie/Donut charts for categorical splits
* Scatter & pair plots
* Heatmaps for correlation

---

### **4. summary.csv**

This file stores the **condensed summary** of the insights extracted during EDA.

**Contains:**

* Key statistical metrics
* Categorized findings
* Important business insights
* Data anomalies
* Recommended actions

It helps in quickly understanding the results without running the notebook.

---

## 🔍 Highlights of Analytical Insights

* Identified top-performing categories and products.
* Observed customer segment patterns influencing sales.
* Determined regions contributing the highest revenue.
* Flagged products frequently triggering auto-reorders.
* Evaluated profit margins & pricing sensitivity.
* Analyzed delivery success vs. payment mode relationships.
* Detected stock-out risks through low inventory zones.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### **1. Generate the Dataset**

```
python data_generator.py
```

This creates **Store_Management_System.csv**.

### **2. Open the EDA Notebook**

```
jupyter notebook eda-store-management.ipynb
```

Run the notebook cells to explore insights and visualizations.

### **3. Review Summary**

Open **summary.csv** to view analytical results in tabular form.
